<h1>Preparations for Python Courses</h1>

There are many ways ways to run Python code to suit most tastes, from the simple command line interpreter to a full
blown Interactive Development Environment such as Dawn.
This guide introduces you to some of the more common methods.
You will need to decide which method you prefer for the upcoming training course.<br/>

To begin with we need to configure Python and be able to execute a simple script; at Diamond, configuring Python is
achieved using the module load command:
<pre>
	module load python/3.7
</pre>
To see that this works you need to run a simple script. Type the following script into a file and try one of the methods
below:
<pre>
	x = 100
	y = 200
	z = x + y
	print(z)
</pre>
Recall that indentation is significant in Python scripts, so make sure each line of the above script starts in column
one.<br/>

Note that Python 2 has reached end of life and therefore we will be using Python 3 throughout this guide.

<h2>1. Running Python from the command line</h2>

After you have issued the module load command, to start up Python 3 type:
<pre>
	python
</pre>
and you will get to a python prompt. This is called the REPL (read-edit-print-loop). Simply enter python commands at the
prompt (or type each line of the above script).
If you want to see the value of a variable you can just type the name of the variable; there is no need to use a print
statement.
This is the simplest way to run Python, but becomes unweildy for larger programs.
<br/>To exit, type:
<pre>
	exit()
</pre>
However, you will loose all your code when you exit the REPL.

<h2>2. Running Python inside a Browser using Jupyter Notebook</h2>
This is a much better approach. You can easily save your work and you can easily check for errors in your code.
You can even convert a notebook into a presentation.<br/>
First, you need to have jupyter installed:
<pre>
	pip install jupyter --user
</pre>
Now you can launch the Jupyter notebook with:
<pre>
	jupyter notebook --browser=firefox
</pre>
The Jupyter notebook lets you create multiple browser consoles to enter Python code. To find out more try the website:
<pre>
	https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/ 
</pre>

<h2>3. Using the Python Debugger on the Command Line</h2>
Create your Python script (e.g. <em>myscript.py</em>em>) with a text editor and then run your script using:
<pre>
	python -m pdb myscript.py
</pre>
Once the debugger starts you can enter debug commands. Use ? to get a list of commands. The most useful commands are:
<pre>
	l	list the contents of the script
	n	execute the (n)ext line
	s	(s)tep into functions
	r	(r)eturn from a function - use need to do an 'n' command to complete the return
	b 5	breakpoint on line 5
	c	continue to next breakpoint
</pre>
The debugger is quite good, but its probably better to use pudb as the debugger (see below).

<h2>4. Using pudb to Debug on the Command Line</h2>
Install pudb:
<pre>
	pip install pudb --user
</pre>
Then type:
<pre>
	python -m pudb myscript.py
</pre>
A simple graphical interface will appear to allow you to debug your program. Commands are essentially the same as pdb,
but you get a nice graphical representation of your source code. Type ? to get a list of commands.

<h2>5. More Sophisticated Environments</h2>
If you want a full blown Interactive Development Envirinment (IDE) you can use one of:
<pre>
	PyCharm
	Eclipse
	Dawn
</pre>
However, be warned that these IDEs are quite complicated with lots of menu options and many windows. There are lots of
guides on how to use thes IDEs on the internet.<br/>
Note that <em>Dawn</em> is essentially a variant of <em>Eclipse</em> which has been customised by Diamond.<br/>
Many people find these IDEs too complicated for their taste (they were developed for professional software engineers) -
you need module load commands for each of these IDEs.<br/>
<em>PyCharm</em> comes in two flavours: community and professional. Note that you need a licence to run PyCharm
Professional; the community edition is the default at Diamond.<br/>
To run one of these IDEs type one of the following pairs of commands:
<pre>
	module load dawn
	dawn&

	module load eclipse
	eclipse&

	module load pycharm
	pycharm&
</pre>

<h2 class="notice">Please make sure you are familiar with at least one of the above methods before you attend the
    course.</h2>
