'''
Use a Monte Carlo simulation to prove that a knight can reach
every square on a chess board.

1. Create an 8x8 Numpy array of zeros
2. Write a generator that computes the next move 
3. Fill in numpy array with a 1 corresponding to a move
4. Print array after N iterations
5. What value of N consistently leads to a complete walk of the board?
